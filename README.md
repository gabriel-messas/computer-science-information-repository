      - Using the same key, the probability of a message M0, when encrypted, being the cyphertext C is the same as the probability that another message M1, when encrypted, is the cyphertext C.

      - The probability of a given message being X, considering that the cyphertext is Y, is the same as the probability of a given message being X.

      - The key should be, at least, as long as the message and be used uniquely with a probability 1/|K| where |K| is the key space.
